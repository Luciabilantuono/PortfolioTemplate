## Project Concept

### What are you building?

I am building a reusable graphic design portfolio template that combines editorial aesthetics with modern web layout techniques. The project focuses on clean structure, strong visual hierarchy, and subtle interactions rather than decorative complexity.

### Who is it for?

This project is intended for graphic designers, visual creatives, and students who need a professional, adaptable portfolio foundation that can be reused and customized for future projects or clients.

### Why does it matter?

Instead of creating a disposable portfolio, this project demonstrates how thoughtful structure, semantic markup, and design systems can result in a scalable and long-lasting web solution suitable for real-world use.

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

The visual style is inspired by editorial design, fashion portfolios, and gallery layouts. The design prioritizes whitespace, typographic hierarchy, square image formats, and minimal color usage to create a refined and contemporary aesthetic.

### Color Palette

- White (#FFFFFF)
- Black (#000000)
- Neutral grayscale tones

### Typography

- Headings: Cal Sans (with system fallbacks)
- Body text: Google Sans Code  
The typography strategy emphasizes contrast between expressive titles and restrained, readable body text.

- Editorial fashion portfolios
- Minimalist gallery-style websites
- Print-inspired digital layouts
