# Project Inspiration

## Trends

- **Editorial Web Design**  
  Web layouts inspired by print media, fashion magazines, and gallery catalogues, prioritizing hierarchy, spacing, and typographic rhythm over traditional UI patterns.

- **Minimal Interaction Design**  
  Subtle, intentional interactions such as hover-based transitions and card flips that enhance storytelling without overwhelming the content.

- **Gallery-Style Project Presentation**  
  Projects displayed as visual objects rather than standard cards, emphasizing square formats, centered compositions, and restrained color usage.

## Theme Draft

This project explores the idea of a graphic design portfolio, where each section functions like a page in a magazine or a curated exhibition. Rather than presenting projects as isolated case studies, the website frames them as visual artifacts within a cohesive narrative, balancing structure, minimalism, and expressive typography.
