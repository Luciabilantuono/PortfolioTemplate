## Project Overview

This project is a **production-ready graphic design portfolio template**, built as a reusable foundation rather than a one-off website.

Instead of creating a static portfolio that becomes obsolete after grading, this project focuses on **structure, scalability, and design systems**, allowing it to be easily cloned, forked, and adapted for future client work or personal projects.

The visual language is inspired by **editorial design, fashion portfolios, and gallery layouts**, emphasizing clarity, hierarchy, and interaction through motion.

## Goals & Concept

- Create a **reusable portfolio template**
- Apply **professional web layout standards**
- Combine **editorial aesthetics** with modern web techniques
- Demonstrate strong **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals**
- Build a system that can be quickly adapted to new projects

- **HTML5** — Semantic structure
