## Project Description & Purpose

This project is a **reusable graphic design portfolio template** built with the goal of creating a strong, adaptable foundation rather than a one-off website.

Instead of focusing on a static portfolio, the project emphasizes **structure, scalability, and design systems**, allowing it to be easily reused, customized, or forked for future personal projects or client work. The design language is inspired by **editorial layouts, fashion portfolios, and gallery-style presentations**, translating print design principles into a digital environment.

The template demonstrates professional standards in layout, interaction, and code organization while maintaining a clean and expressive visual identity.

## Tech Stack Used

- **HTML5** — Semantic structure and accessible markup  
- **CSS3** — Layout systems, responsive design, transitions, and 3D transforms  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)** — Interactivity and hover-based animations  
- **No frameworks or build tools** — Lightweight, portable, and easy to maintain
